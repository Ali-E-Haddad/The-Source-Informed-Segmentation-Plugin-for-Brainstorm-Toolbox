This plugin employs the Source-Informed Segmentation Algorithm [1] in the temporal segmentation of EEG files within the Brainstorm toolbox [2]. The plugin segments the EEG data in the files passed to it and returns a new set of files, with the processed EEG data marked by the detected segment boundaries as extended events, which can be found in the (.Event) field of each processed file. Furthermore, the parameters and secondary outcomes of the Source-Informed Segmentation Algorithm and other options used by the plugin are saved to the (.SISegment) field added to each of these processed files (see section 6). The processed files are added back to the Brainstorm workspace. Additionally, the plugin collects various statistics which summarize the performed segmentation processes. The statistics are displayed after the completion of all segmentation processes, and can optionally be saved to a user selected file.
The plugin can be applied either to one set of files, to be processed and statistically summarized together, or to two sets of files, to be equivalently processed then compared using the same statistical measures.
